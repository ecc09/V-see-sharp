        <p class="lead">The carbon footprint, also known as the greenhouse gas footprint, is an indicator used to compare the total 
            amount of greenhouse gases emitted from an activity, product, company, or country.
             It is usually reported in tons of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per unit of comparison, such as per year, person, kg of protein,
             km traveled, and more. The carbon footprint includes the emissions for the entire life cycle from production along the supply 
             chain to final consumption and disposal
